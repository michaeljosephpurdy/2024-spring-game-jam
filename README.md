**Theme:** Changing Sides

_(Optional) restriction: The Chosen One

## The idea

An auto-runner similar to Geometry Dash.

The player (a polygon) can **change sides** by flipping gravity.
They were running on the bottom of the screen, now they are running on the top of the screen.

They can also **change sides** by incrementing or decrementing the amount of sides they have.
You start as a triangle, and increment up to an octagon.
You are forced to increment/decrement to fit through certain parts of the level.
